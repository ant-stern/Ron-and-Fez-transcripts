[00:00:00]  And also Jay from Framingham has made a rare appearance into the AF studio.  I like how Jay comes into the studio these days.  He comes barging through the door like it's the opening credits of a sitcom.  It's like, ah, you expect a freeze-frame smile, and Jay!  Ah, and as. I'm the and as.  Oh, you're the and as? The wacky neighbor?  Oh, and don't forget, the Opie and Anthony show today is dedicated to Christopher Glover.  That's right.  Doing time at Walpole.  Our captive audience member. 
[00:00:30]  Yes.  You've got to explain that story again, because the uncle finally called back, thank God.  So it looks like I'm not going to have my skull crushed in.  Well, yesterday we were signing the new CD, Royal Flush, at Strawberries in Quincy.  Quincy, right?  Yes.  We learned how to say Quincy, finally.  It's only been two and a half years that I've been saying Quincy.  Please. It took me long enough to say Peabody.  Peabody.  So this guy comes in, big guy.  And he asks if we could dedicate a Metallica song to his nephew, Christopher, who is in Walpole prison. 
[00:01:00]  Christopher Glover.  That's right.  The show's dedicated to Christopher Glover.  It most certainly is.  Okay.  For God's sake.  For your sake.  Right.  So, uh, Opie says, yeah.  And I would have.  It's rough when we are on location.  We're doing a remote.  People come up and ask for a song.  It's very hard for us because we have a list at that point of what music's going to be played  because there's a guy working the board here back at the station.  Right.  And it's, you know, you don't want to get on and go, could you go back now with everything 
[00:01:30]  else you're doing, find this CD, rearrange the set list, you know, and everything.  It's just a pain in the ass.  It's easier when we're sitting here.  But for some reason, Opie felt he didn't want to explain that to the gentleman.  I figured if, you know, we played some Metallica, I would quickly say, hey, this is for Christopher  Glover.  Right.  Walpole.  We didn't play any Metallica.  And I also figured if we didn't get to it yesterday, we would do it today.  Well, he didn't care.  Okay.  So I left early to go to the Selts Gate last night.  So I lambasted Opie for leaving me there alone for the last break and, you know, signed 
[00:02:00]  off.  And I see the guy come back to the door.  He's a huge mother.  Yeah.  And he's pissed.  Yeah.  He's like, where's Opie?  At an effing basketball game?  Right.  He goes, that mother effer said that he was going to request a dedicated Metallica song  to my nephew.  Now, I don't want to.  And he lied to me.  And I'm taking this personally.  And he's a little S, F, every other letter that means something to him.  You're leaving out one detail. 
[00:02:30]  What?  This guy did some time.  Oh, yeah.  Not like a year.  He did some time.  Yeah.  And you don't want to piss off these type of guys.  He was upset.  Right.  So, I, you know, I had to diffuse the situation without just turning around and taking the  easy way of going, yeah, he is an a-hole, Opie.  You know, that Opie is a big, dumb son.  You just kick his ass next time you see him.  Trying to get the heat off me.  Yeah.  But, no, and I told him, today, when we are in the studio, I will make sure it is taken 
[00:03:00]  care of.  Yeah.  And we dedicated the whole show to Christopher Glover, who was spending his years in Walpole.  In Walpole.  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  And the guy heard that we dedicated the show to Christopher Walpole.  Big guy.  Christopher Glover.  Sorry.  He said he got choked up.  Yeah.  A little teary-eyed, he says.  Right.  I was there, you know, I'm caving some guy's head in, and I hear you dedicated to my nephew.  I'm getting a little misty.  I had to stop, you know, I'm beating him up with a tire on, and I had to pull over and 
[00:03:30]  stop.  You know, I had a moment right there, is what I had.  You know, when it was done, I commenced the pounding again, but I stopped for a minute.  Remember, Anthony just did that little bit.  No, no, that wasn't me.  Anthony did that.  That was Jay from Framingham.  If you ever see Jay from Framingham, kick his ass.  That's right.  All right.  Can we move on?  Yes, let's move on on Christopher Glover Day.  Yes, Christopher Glover Day.  Don't forget, our interview with Green Day will be on Real Rock TV Saturday night at midnight 
[00:04:00]  on WUNI.  Not only that, but on a mall porn star.  Where we pour the paint over her loveliness.  Pictures on the underground website.  I mention the Green Day, because we're going to play some Green Day.  Off Nimrod.  Let's set your ride with the straight cats.  This is the straight cat strut.  Station that really rocks, 107.3 WAF, Fu Manchu.  That's Evil Eye.  That's a WAF exclusive from one of the bands playing the WAF three-day holiday rage. 
[00:04:30]  They are playing on the first night with Days of the New and God Smack, Monday, December 8th.  Tickets available through Ticketmaster, 931-2000.  All three shows happening at Mama Kid Music Hall.  You've got to be 21 plus.  They cost $10 in advance.  Three-show package, $25.  Do you need any more info on this?  And we're giving away tickets for Ticketmaster Thursday for the second night, which features Pissed On, Head Swim, and Gooch Thumb.  We've got Shelly Belly working the phones. 
[00:05:00]  We'll give a pair to the seventh caller right now at 931-1AF.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, and it's Jay from Framingham.  Dude, we've got to tell Jay about Crazy Jim yesterday.  Oh, God, that was disgusting.  Man, Crazy Jim.  Where is Crazy Jim?  If Crazy Jim's listening in the sales area, run down the hall.  We want you on the air again today.  He told a story.  He actually stayed up one night calculating how much, as he says, batch I've thrown over my life. 
[00:05:30]  But, you know, his equation was pretty logical.  That's what scared me.  His love seed.  And he was just talking through self-abuse, not even like with a partner.  Well, he's 35 years old, and he's figured he's been doing it since he was about 16.  Yeah.  That's starting late, I think.  Well, he was giving, he was always rounding off down, you know, to a lower number, and it was still ridiculous. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Then he figured he had done it once every other day.  Even though he says, he does it every day and sometimes up to four times a day.  So this is really cutting it low.  And then he figured that it would be a quarter ounce per batch.  Batch.  As he so eloquently puts it, batch.  And it worked out, if you do the math, to a whopping 6.7 gallons of batch. 
[00:06:30]  Batch.  So I said, I'm not going over to your house and making sandwiches anytime soon.  Got milk?  All you picture is six gallons, almost seven gallon jugs full of this demon seed.  I know when I go and buy, like, the gallon waters at Shaw's, I got to make two trips from the trunk if I have three.  And he's talking like seven jugs. 
[00:07:00]  Well, he added to the end.  Of batch.  He added to the thing today in the back room.  That's why I wanted to get him on the air, but I guess he's.  Oh, he did?  I guess he's actually working today.  Working on a new bed.  You know when you give blood and you get those lovely gold, you know, blood drop pins?  Blood droplet.  Sure.  He wants to make sperm pins.  White sperm pins.  So when you get up to, like, four or five gallons, you get the white sperm pins. 
[00:07:30]  What is wrong with me?  This is what goes to this guy's head.  What is wrong?  Remember the other day we were doing the bid on the land of Misfit Adult Toys?  Oh, wait.  Let's play it so people have a reference.  Okay.  Is that cool?  Yeah, you can play it first, I guess.  All right.  This is Anthony from the other day.  But they did have that voice, you know.  Yeah.  Well, that's where I got the voice from.  It's a Charlie in the box.  Yeah.  The land of Misfit Toys, don't you know? 
[00:08:00]  I love that scene.  The land of Misfit Sex Toys.  No one wants a blow-up tie with no holes.  We're all Misfits.  Look, a poor dildo with four hands.  No one wants that, don't you know?  Now, this is the land of Misfit Adult Toys.  Misfit Adult Toys.  Okay.  Benoit Cubes.  Benoit Cubes.  Nobody wants Benoit Cubes.  Of course not.  Look over here.  Sand paper butt plugs.  Ah, jeez. 
[00:08:30]  Condoms lubricated with Ben Gay, don't you know?  No one wants those.  I don't want to be an elf.  I want to be a porn star.  And the kid wanted to be a dentist.  Yeah, he wanted to be a damn dentist.  With that swiping hair going.  Right.  Yeah, it wasn't quite as scary, though.  There was Anthony from the other day.  Yes.  When we were trying to think of sex toys.  Right.  That we could, you know, pervert into unwanted sex toys.  We went to Jim.  Yeah.  And he starts rattling off all these sex toys. 
[00:09:00]  And you know, it's not just that he saw them in a catalog or heard friends talking about  him.  You know these are in his house somewhere.  They're in his house.  Yeah.  How about anal beads?  He's saying.  And you know, he's used them at some point in his life.  Yeah, we were going to use anal squares for that bit, actually, I remember, instead of  the anal beads.  But Jane just came in.  Crazy Jim's in a cell feeding until 530.  So.  I hope no one's shaking his hand.  Really?  You know, speaking of the sperm thing. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Someone sent me an email, and I want to see if this is true or not, that some girls are  allergic to sperm.  I've heard that.  You have heard that?  Yes.  Some of the enzymes, Opie.  Really?  Intained in sperm does give.  So what happens if you're allergic to sperm?  I think you get like inflamed inside.  Really?  I'm inflamed.  I think you cut your hair real short, and you become a gym teacher.  You get that special haircut, spiky on top, log in the back. 
[00:10:00]  All right, girls.  Come on.  I'm allergic to sperm.  Clodding the ropes, girls.  Come on.  Toes on the line, ladies.  Come on.  Time to watch that hygiene film.  Everyone.  Come on.  In the classroom.  I'm going to go watch you in the locker room change.  Come on, girls.  I'm allergic to sperm.  Well, I want to hear from some girls that are allergic to sperm.  Now, if you're allergic to this, you go to the doctor, and what happens? 
[00:10:30]  You know, like when you're allergic to cats or peanut butter or milk products and stuff,  they prick you with a bunch of needles?  Well, if you're allergic to sperm, do they, I don't know, prick you with a bunch of, you  know what, to see what happens?  I'm going to have to probe her case.  I don't know.  Well, that is an interesting question you pose.  Allergic to sperm.  You're allergic to sperm.  Do you get pricked to see if you're allergic to it?  You've got to use some type of, I guess, condom, maybe. 
[00:11:00]  Okay.  How embarrassing if they have to go to a doctor for the swollen tongue.  With that but a comedy, we've got to rock on.  Let's rock on, everyone.  Oh, sending this one out to the gang on the Southeast Expressway.  I was in your hell yesterday, and I totally feel for you today.  It's A.F.  I can't believe in you.  Whoa.  What's going on over there? 
[00:11:30]  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Shwing.  Wow.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Wow.  107.3 WAF, the only station that really rocks.  Wow.  I feel much better.  Ready to guess the machine and the ghost of time.  Joe.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  It's Jay from Framingham.  Man, she still smells good, too.  Yeah.  Kind of.  The aroma.  Everyone go for the WAF.  Okay.  And Crazy Jim in the studio, because we were talking about your sperm equation from yesterday. 
[00:12:00]  It's sweeping the nation.  Everyone is trying to figure out their own sperm equations at home because of you from yesterday.  Excellent.  I wonder how many gallons are sitting out there unused.  You figured that there was six and a half gallons over your career of spanking it.  6.7.  6.7 gallons.  6.7 gallons of batch you have produced.  That you have done over the years.  Right.  You know those things that spackle come in?  What are those?  Yeah.  Five-gallon?  Yeah, that's like a big spackle thing.  Hello, I'm here to spackle your wall. 
[00:12:30]  You could cover a lot of holes with that.  Wow.  The stuff that they, like, seal your driveway with, that's five gallons.  Five gallons.  Five-gallon pail.  That's more than that.  And so you figured in 19 years, because you started spanking at 16?  Right.  Me and I were discussing this.  That's a little late in life to learn how to do it, bro.  I know.  Well, I came from a...  He's making up for lost time.  Yeah, exactly.  I had a Catholic upbringing, so we didn't talk about that stuff.  Right around when I was 16, I got a hold of my mother's joyous sex book. 
[00:13:00]  Oh.  That outdated thing.  Right, exactly.  That's so funny how the parents are trying to, like, you know, honey, we've got to get  back to the old days like it was.  Let's get the joy of sex and look at these pencil illustrations of people doing it.  Right.  So I get to the page where it was talking about masturbation, and it had, like, you know,  you could do the hand holding a carrot or the inverted thumb thing.  So I'm in the bathroom, right?  It's the very first time, and I'm, like, looking at these diagrams going, uh-huh, and up and 
[00:13:30]  down, and up and...  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  And I remember really not knowing what was going to happen at the end, right?  Right, right.  It's like seeing a movie for the first time.  Right, exactly.  It's like, kablam, you know?  Were you frightened?  Oh, it was awesome.  I was in the bathroom, and I'm like,  And my mother's knocking on the door like, 
[00:14:00]  Oh, no.  Is everything all right in there?  I'm like, no, no.  I'm like trying to pull my underwear out of my ass cheeks.  Come on.  I just cinched up so hard, I had like my shirt up there, you know?  Oh, man.  My thighs look like a racehorse, you know?  They were all like totally swollen with blood.  So I go downstairs, and I dial up my friends, 
[00:14:30]  and I'm like, you'll never believe what I just figured out.  You've got to check this out.  Get in the bathroom, man.  It doesn't even cost anything, guys.  It's the best.  Thanks for sharing.  It's not like anyone's listening.  Nineteen years of that.  Nineteen years.  I was telling Anthony, before I went on vacation a couple weeks ago,  I get up on Friday, right?  I'm leaving.  I got like a five-hour ride in front of me.  I get up.  I throw one.  I pack some clothes. 
[00:15:00]  To the layman.  I throw another one, right?  Wow.  It's not like noontime.  I'm getting ready to leave the house.  I got to throw a third one, because I got a long ride.  I won't be able to do it for a while.  You might have some form of obsession with that.  You think so?  I have a question for you.  So you've decided you've thrown 6.7 gallons of batch in 19 years, right?  It's a lot of griddle, flicks.  Now, that's just throwing it.  What about the batches that went?  Other places.  Well, women.  Right. 
[00:15:30]  So we're not even calculating that incident.  I've got to be over like the 7-gallon mark.  I was actually thinking, you know when you go to the Red Cross, right?  Right.  You give a couple gallons of blood.  They give you a little pin.  It's like a tear drop.  And it's got a number on it.  Like, you know, I've given 2 gallons.  You get like a 2, right?  Oh, no.  You're not proposing.  So I'm thinking about making these up, and they'll look like a little, you know,  a white spermy thing, and you can have a number on it.  Hey, you're in the 8 Club.  That's good, you know?  Your sack must look like raisins.  There's 10 gallons that'll put your picture in the paper. 
[00:16:00]  Exactly.  We're up at the post office.  Of what, Hustler?  Oh, that's too funny.  You're a busy man, Jay.  There you go.  That's great.  You done?  Yeah, I'm done.  All right, we've got to play this for Jim, huh?  Oh, yeah.  From Domain and World, it's a Mastivator.  Yeah.  On AF.  Sitting in my house, and I know that I'm alone.  Feeling kind of horny, got a tingle in my bone.  Going grab a penthouse, it's the one with Jared Stone.  Hey, Mastivator. 
[00:16:30]  Going through the doctor and it's feeling kind of nice.  Once ain't enough, so I have to do it twice.  You want to smack the monkey, I can give you good advice.  Hey, Mastivator.  I use some baby oil or a little Vaseline.  Laying down a towel so I keep my carpet clean.  Never shake my hand because you don't know where it's been.  Hey, Mastivator.  I do it in my car while I'm driving down the street. 
[00:17:00]  One hand on the wheel and the other on my meat.  I can't get out the car because I'm taking through the teeth.  Hey, Mastivator.  Since I was a kid, I have been a Mastivator.  Choked the chicken, holding the knob, squeezing the tomato.  I clipped him in November, now I'm going to take a raider.  Hey, Mastivator.  Buffing the banana, little lizard shaking, breaking. 
[00:17:30]  Pounding on the flounder and its mayonnaise I'm making.  Spike the frank, what's the carrot, got my hand is aching.  Hey, Mastivator.  Hey, Mastivator.  Hey, Mastivator.  Hey, Mastivator.  You got to do that for the air. 
[00:18:00]  You just got to do it.  You got to explain that very carefully.  Because every guy can relate to this.  That's a Masturbator from the Better World, by the way.  Crazy Jim has one last thought on his whole masturbation.  The guys can relate to this.  You know, when you do yourself, you pleasure yourself, and you finish.  Right.  Right.  You make your completion.  Yeah.  You stop.  You don't keep touching yourself.  No, you're done.  You can't, right?  But if you're in the sack and you're having someone do it for you, then you can just lay 
[00:18:30]  there and enjoy the moment, right?  And they keep moving their hand.  All right.  To the most sensitive of areas.  Right.  Well, you're talking when after you've made your...  Yeah, you're done.  You've made your statement.  You're bad.  You're bad.  Don't forget bad.  This is a lesson for the ladies out there.  If you don't know this yet, go ahead.  You've made your statement, and you're done, basically, and they keep moving their hand  around the most sensitive area.  You get that whole, like... 
[00:19:00]  You look like Bill the Cat, you know, one eye's all blown up, your tongue's hanging up.  Say all kinds of stupid stuff.  So the lesson, kiddies, after the act is complete, you do not, if you're a woman, please don't  touch it.  But you like it. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, absolutely.  No way.  Don't touch it.  Nah.  Don't touch it.  Let it cool off.  Grab a beer and watch the rest of the game.  That's right.  All right.  Are we done?  We're fit.  All right.  Let's rock out with Tracy Bottom and Mother Mother on the...  It's Opie and Anthony and the rest of the gang.  Now, Fredo has joined the AF studio.  Some...  The regular party.  It is.  Crazy Jim, we've put him in the back of the room for a while.  Crazy Jim and his wacky masturbation stories. 
[00:20:00]  Thanks for sharing today, Crazy Jim.  We appreciate it.  The most sexually active man in the world.  It is with himself, but he's the most sexually active man in the world.  I want you to share the shower bit really fast.  Oh, my...  Because that's really funny, too.  The Coolio line is...  Yeah.  Okay, go ahead.  Sometimes in the shower, when you do it, and you let it fly, throw a batch, as you like.  And if you don't aim right, it, like, hits your leg.  And when it hits the... 
[00:20:30]  When the water hits it, it turns to, like, postage stamp glue.  It turns to that, like, paste we had in third grade, right?  And it totally gets bunged up in the hairs on your legs.  And then when you dry off, they all, like, twist together and mat up.  So then my leg ends up looking like Coolio's head.  I'm having a bad hair day on my calf.  No matter how much soap you use.  And it won't come up. 
[00:21:00]  You end up eventually pulling it out.  So you got these...  Oh, my God.  It looks like I got the creeping gunga on my leg because I've got all these patches of hair missing, you know?  Yep.  It's the creeping gunga.  I've seen this before in India.  What do they call that thing?  When the kids in grade school, their hair used to fall out.  I don't know.  Mange.  You're right.  My legs look like I got the mange.  I look like someone was making paintbrushes from the hair on my legs.  Model paintbrushes.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Jeff. 
[00:21:30]  You are just leading an interesting life.  You in the shower.  He's doing things.  You're amazing.  All right.  What else is in the news today?  I'm looking at the nanny.  Yes.  She wants to go home.  She can until March now.  At the earliest?  Yeah.  They're actually appealing.  Right.  But they keep going back to England and showing the people that are waiting eagerly for her  to come home.  And they won't leave those pubs over there while they're dwindling, though. 
[00:22:00]  I know, but there's still a couple of them left.  I'm staying right here until Louise is back in jolly old England.  I swear I'm not leaving this pub until Louise.  No, we have to stand vigil for Louise.  It's all for another pint, would you please?  Another pint.  I'm here until she is back where she belongs back home.  And she says, hey, what are you doing, mate?  Shut him up with one tooth. 
[00:22:30]  No, we're both not leaving.  I'll take a shot with that if you want.  A little bit of bourbon.  It's for Louise.  It's all for Louise.  And I'm not budging until she's back.  Wow, my teeth.  It's so true.  Well, the people that are holding the candlelight vigils outside the courthouse.  It's a tuplet mother laughs at my teeth.  Nice.  That's good.  The vigil that they're doing outside the courthouse in Cambridge is down to three people.  Is it three people that care? 
[00:23:00]  It used to be hundreds.  Now there's three.  It's amazing with the news.  You know, it's the biggest story and people are involved.  After a while, no one cares.  It's like, okay, I'm going to get to the mall and get some Christmas shopping done.  That's it.  No one cares.  No one cares.  Shake the baby doll.  You see that one yet?  Yeah.  You shake.  This is great.  I saw it on the news.  They're selling these dolls that you shake it and the baby laughs.  And now there's this huge uproar that it's going to give children the wrong message.  Well, did you see the head when you shake the thing?  Yeah.  It looks like one of those dogs in the back window of the car. 
[00:23:30]  It's like, I live in my room.  We've got to get some of those dolls and give them away on our show, without a doubt.  If someone can make that happen, please, please get those dolls for us.  We'll give them away right here on the radio.  Cool.  All right.  Quick, get your ass off the couch and go do some report.  Yes, Opie.  We are so late.  Get your ass off the couch for a large sponsor.  It's by Cider Jack.  Look for Cider Jack's new seasonal spiced hard cider.  Now available at your favorite bar or retail store, for God's sake.  Middle East, the Dirty Larry, seedy release party with W.O.C.C. 
[00:24:00]  Om!  And every second at the Paradise Max Creek at Bill's Bar Twisted Roots, half-cocked and glazed.  Presented by Jim Burrell.  No.  What?  Alfredo and I will actually be at Tim's Toolhouse tonight in Worcester.  Really?  54 Milbury Street for Cider Jack.  Well, there you go.  We've got passes to ski.  Passes to ski?  Okay.  And make sure you go out and see Flubber, my new movie.  Watch me jump around and say things that aren't even funny and you'll laugh at them because 
[00:24:30]  I'm holding this piece of rubber and it's really fun.  Robin, that wasn't funny.  But I'm in it.  Look, look.  I'm catching it with a catcher's mitt.  Isn't that funny?  No.  Well, okay.  All right.  Get your ass off the couch.  Get out and do something.  Reluctantly crouched.  Swim and good thumb.  And we're giving away tickets to that show as part of Tickle Blitz Thursday.  If you're the seventh caller right now, you've got a pair. 
[00:25:00]  931-1AAF.  And the lovely and talented Anne-Marie walked in the studio a little while ago and it's  official.  The third night with Creed and Cellophane is sold out.  Gone.  Sold out.  See?  So we've got tickets for the first night and the second night.  You're schnoosh.  And I know for a fact the first night's going to sell out very soon because, I mean, come  on.  Days of the New, Fu Manchu and Godsmack.  You can get your tickets right now through Ticketmaster, 931-2000. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  So how do you feel about this whole Demented World thing going national?  Well, it's pretty cool.  I wish some of the DJs playing it would say it's, you know, Opie and Anthony.  But I'm not surprised.  You're not surprised, right?  No, of course.  Unbelievable.  They do this all the time, radio DJs, because they're so used to not writing their own stuff  that they just think no one writes their own stuff so everything's up for grabs without  having to give credit to anybody.  That's right.  Well, the reports are coming in.  We sent out 800 CDs all over the country and the reports are coming back that our stuff 
[00:26:00]  is being played in other cities.  Oh, yeah.  But we're not getting credit yet.  No.  So hopefully, I guess we've got to just be patient.  But the guy from South Carolina is back on the line.  Oh, yes?  Some guy from up here going to school in South Carolina called to say he heard, what, butt  plug down there?  Butt plug.  Butt plug in South Carolina and the morning show down there did not give us credit.  And he's back on the line.  Yo, bro.  Yo, you're back, huh?  Yeah, man.  What do you got? 
[00:26:30]  I called all the people from Boston that go to school here.  Yeah.  I got about 20 people.  We're all pissed off.  We're thinking about burning the station down.  Dude, you have some serious support down here in South Carolina.  Make sure all you guys start calling the station and say, hey, that's from Opie and Anthony.  Give them credit.  Tomorrow morning, I'm going to organize a big thing.  The guy does the morning show.  We're all going to call him up and bitch him out.  Thank you, dude.  Let us know.  Yeah, no problem, man.  All right, brother.  You guys rock.  Thank you.  Bye.  You want to hear another call? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  This is about Mancow's show.  Oh, Mancow is syndicated all over the country and he's playing our stuff.  What's up, brother?  Hey, on the way home from work this morning, I had the Mancow show on.  Yeah.  And he played a Christmas song, too.  From Demand World?  Yeah.  And?  He didn't say nothing.  Oh, come on.  Jeez.  Are you serious?  I am serious.  It was probably around 8.30 this morning.  There's two days in a row he's playing stuff from Demand World and not giving us credit.  The guy is syndicated all over the country. 
[00:27:30]  Just give us credit.  I don't care.  We don't want money for our stuff.  We just want credit.  Credit!  Just a little bit.  We did that song.  We did it.  Someone call him up tomorrow and tell him.  He's a huge offender.  Oh, my God.  Just like the other one.  We don't get credit for Hey, Masturbator.  There's e-mails going all over the country saying that Adam Sandler wrote a song called  Hey, Masturbator.  No, it was Opie and Anthony.  It's on our Demand World CD.  Just give us some credit! 
[00:28:00]  Thanks, bro.  Hey, no problem.  All right.  Later.  Some guy e-mailed me last night, gave me a location, web site.  It's this guy in Vancouver, British Columbia, and he's got all these song parodies on his  website written out, and one is the Macarena Blues.  So I click on it, and there it is.  Hey, Masturbator.  But there's something weird about some of the versions that are on the net.  There's so many on the net. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Everything ends in A.  That's not how you wrote it.  I sit in my house, and I know that I'm a lona.  Lona.  The only kind of honey got a tingle in my bona.  No, I didn't put an A at the end of it.  Right.  If you see it, delete the A's.  Please.  So I wrote the guy a letter and, you know, let him know who did it.  Well, if you get the Adam Sandler e-mail where it says, this is written by Adam Sandler.  It's the words, hey, Masturbator, please respond to those e-mails and send them straight and  tell them where they can find the damn song.  We'd appreciate that.  Adam Sandler.  Right?  Please.  All right.  And according to the paper today, the CD has raised $17,000 for the New England homeless 
[00:29:00]  veterans.  Not bad.  I think it's actually a lot higher, but I think it's closer to $20,000.  But that's cool.  Whatever.  And don't forget, tomorrow in the Boston Globe, a story on op and ac and demented worlds.  Keep your fingers crossed, but I think we're going to get trashed again.  I wish it was TV.  Maybe me and you could jump around like a blithering idiot.  With our mashed potato butt.  Simple as this.  You want disco, listen to BC.  You want rock and roll, you keep it right here. 
[00:29:30]  It's a W.A.F. exclusive, and they're playing the second night of the three-day holiday  rage with Pissed On and Goods Thumb.  Goods Thumb.  I think we gave all our tickets away, didn't we?  Yes, we did.  All right.  Well, Rocco's in next to continue Ticket Blitz Thursday.  We did a lot today, huh?  We had fun today, I believe.  The Christopher Glover show is over.  The show is dedicated to a guy doing some hard time in Walpole.  Walpole.  Don't ask.  It's a long story.  We had some fun talking to Crazy Jim and his masturbation stories. 
[00:30:00]  Any last tidbits you want to add to that?  I think he pretty much, yeah, every tip you would want.  No, I saved plenty for later.  Well, the best was the argument he had with the guy who claimed that he could, oh, after  he leaves a deposit in the bottom of the tub.  No, the eye thing.  Oh, yeah.  A guy calls up, and he's like, oh, dude, I'm in the shower, and you've got to be careful  not to get it in your eye. 
[00:30:30]  And I'm thinking, well, you shouldn't be bending over trying to stick it in your face.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He always knows just where to.  Oh, test the envelopes.  Anybody that gets it in their eye, man, that's a feat.  But you were telling us, Mike, that you want, well, that was laying on my back.  Now, somebody that gets it in their eye laying on their back like I did, that was an accident.  It was going end over end like a football.  like when they kick a football and go and i'm not paying attention i'm it right in the throes 
[00:31:00]  of ecstasy right and then all of a sudden i'm like ah that's salty oh all right all right  what about the other thing you're saying where you threw a batch over your right shoulder  for good luck for good luck oh i spilt the salt i guess i gotta throw a batch over my right shoulder  uh we have plenty more stories for later yeah can't wait thanks everything you've ever wanted  to know about pleasuring yourself all right well that is scary though the first time you do that 
[00:31:30]  you don't know what to expect you don't know what's going on no one really gave you the hint of what's  going on so you just keep going going going and it's great feels great and then all of a sudden  like boosh and you're like what the hell is going on should our fathers have like sat us down and  said uh here's some vaseline here's a porno mag go to town i don't know what it's like now with  kids growing up that are you know 12 13 whatever but uh back then your parents you did not discuss 
[00:32:00]  sex with your dad not at all because it always gave you conjured up the image of whatever he was  telling you him doing with mom right so you never wanted to think of that i had four four brothers my  brother my oldest brother comes in the room one time i guess he hadn't figured out how to do this i'm  i'm sprawled out on the bed i got a penthouse going i'm smacking it for all it's worth it's  just like bow bow bow he opens the door and he's like oh my god what are you doing oh i'm gonna tell

[00:33:00]  with a high-powered rifle because there's a point where you're first realizing about it like like  through uh self-pleasuring like a crazy gem or uh anything where where maybe if you hear now  sounds coming from your parents room through a wall oh that was it didn't matter when you're eight  nine years old you don't know what's going on when you're 13 and like there's your mom like  you're just like  daddy's hurting mama again daddy's hurting mama man he's really putting it to her he's hurting her
