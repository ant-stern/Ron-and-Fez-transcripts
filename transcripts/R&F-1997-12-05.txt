[00:00:00]  Also a good song off Days of the New called Face of the Earth.  Face of the Earth.  Got a chance to see Days of the New.  They're playing the first night of the three-day holiday rage, Monday, December 8th, with Fu Manchu and Godsmack.  I cannot believe that this show isn't sold out yet.  I'm absolutely amazed, because last time they were in town, the place freaked out to check out these guys live.  You can get your tickets through Ticketmaster 931-2000.  Also, tickets still available for the second night with Piston, Head Swim, and Goodstum.  Goodstum.  Third night, sold out, so I won't talk about it, because you'll just get bummed out, right? 
[00:00:30]  Right.  Okay.  Hey, Ope.  What's new?  F.U. Friday?  F.U. Friday is here, yes.  F.U. to, uh, I got a new F.U. to the trains.  To the trains?  In this Commonwealth.  All right, why?  Because you could sit there for like 15 minutes while 8,000 cars go by.  No, no, no, dude, that only happens in your neighborhood.  Is that my crossing right there?  Your tiny little town of Ashland is the, I think, is the last town in America that allows 
[00:01:00]  five miles of trains to go by while you wait at a light.  It's a cozy little hamlet, and it takes me either 15 minutes to get here, or it takes  me an hour to get here, depending on how long the train is.  Tell them to build an overpass.  Ah, they'll never do that.  My God.  That's why I don't visit you anymore.  I know.  Tired of getting stuck by the train.  Of course I am.  Well, F.U.  Well, we got a lovely article in the Boston Globe today.  Well, look at that, huh?  Yeah.  I don't know if it's a good article or a bad article, or if it's just an article that's 
[00:01:30]  there.  Yeah, I think it's, you know, just there.  It's kind of there.  If you want to read it, it's in the Boston Globe in the back of the sports section.  The headline is called, Comfortably Dumb.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I guess.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  We're dumb?  No, we're dumb and dumber.  Oh, I got you.  Comfortably dumb.  Comfortably dumb.  A little play on words.  You know, I might be an asshole, but I consider myself pretty smart, actually.  Me too.  But comfortably dumb, whatever.  That's fine. 
[00:02:00]  And it says, tasteless humor and pranks from AF shock jocks.  Of course, they're talking about our lovely CD, Demanded World.  Of course.  Which is now sweeping the nation.  Yes.  The one thing they failed to mention in this article, which I'm kind of bummed about, we've  raised $20,000 for the New England Homeless Vets.  It's not mentioned at all in here.  They didn't mention that?  No.  I don't know why.  You see?  They had enough time to mention me as the swarthy, wild-haired Anthony.  Yeah, where is that?  Okay.  Is that a racial slur?  I'm Sicilian.  So I guess that's like a Mediterranean thing. 
[00:02:30]  Well, let me go back to this.  There it is.  They ask us about our comedic vision.  I sound like a homo the way I'm talking about you.  I know.  That's why I want to read this.  Come on.  Opie and Anthony's comedic vision, they ask us.  All right.  We try to tie in to current events and bring in some observational humor, muses Opie, the  tiger beat blonde, as he's called by the swarthy, wild-haired Anthony.  Like, I call you that all the time.  I was saying because, you know, a lot of the young girls call up for Opie here, and they're 
[00:03:00]  like, oh, Opie, I love you.  I love you.  So I was like, yeah, you should be on the cover of, like, Tiger Beat with all the young  girls that call up the station.  So she puts it like, I call you that.  I know.  I'm on the phone.  Hello, hello, my blonde-haired tiger beat, teen tiger beat cover Opie.  How are you today?  It's your pal, the swarthy, wild-haired Anthony.  And I had my hat on that day.  Imagine if I would have unleashed my hair.  I think she's looking at your hairdo from the CD cover of Demented World. 
[00:03:30]  Probably.  And, you know, it makes me sound like the Bushman of the Kalahari.  Well, I don't know.  Me, me, go, village.  Eat your children.  Me, go, village.  I think I have a pretty large vocabulary.  I don't think I've ever seen the word swarthy used in a sentence.  It's like a dark, olive-complected Mediterranean, you know, that whole thing.  Is it?  Yeah, like, you know, a terrorist would be swarthy. 
[00:04:00]  Swarthy.  Well, that's how I joke about you.  I'm a terrorist.  Well, this is the deal.  If you're, you know, at home and you can help us out, someone fax us the definition  of swarthy.  Oh, thank you.  Right from the dictionary, please.  Swarthy.  S-W-A-R-T-H-Y.  All right?  Okay.  Tiger Beat Blonde.  The faxes are already coming in saying hi to the Tiger Beat Blonde and the swarthy  wild-haired one.  Thank you.  So there you go.  If you want to read it for yourself, there's other interesting things.  Bunga, bunga, binga, binga, bunga, binga, bunga. 
[00:04:30]  Bunga, binga, binga, bunga.  Bunga, binga, binga, binga, binga, binga.  Yeah, it's like I'm an aborigines.  You got one of those lip plates in your lip now.  Yeah, I mean, plates in my lips and rings around my neck.  And I'm going to put a bone through my nose.  For Christ's sake.  My swarthy, wild-haired friend.  Yar, my swarthy friend.  Arr.  I don't know what's worse, being called a Tiger Beat Blonde or a swarthy, wild-haired one.  I think the swarthy is a little worse than that. 
[00:05:00]  You, I mean, you know, Hanson is blonde Tiger Beat guy.  That's what I mean.  That kind of does suck.  That does suck.  You know, me, I'm Abdul Mohamed.  You got to, like, stretch your earlobes now.  Yeah.  You got to stretch your earlobes really long so they hit your shoulders.  You got to put one of those huge lip plates in so you can scoop up your food.  You know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to walk around the station with one of those hollowed-out carrot-looking things on my schween like they did on the Discovery Channel. 
[00:05:30]  And I'm going to hunt baboons with a blowgun because I'm the swarthy, wild-haired Anthony.  There's some really interesting stuff in this article.  Pick it up for yourself.  It's in the sports section of the Boston Globe.  I don't know how we made it to the back of the sports section, but whatever.  They want to hide us.  They did want to hide us, and that's fine.  We don't get much respect in this town, and we're not expecting it.  Cute little picture in there. 
[00:06:00]  It looks like both of us were stuck in the headlights like deers caught in the headlights.  Well, you know, because I know there's a lot of people that have seen the article already.  Me and Anthony don't sit, like, down the studio.  I know.  We don't.  That was a picture that was set up for the Boston Globe.  Because Bruce was going, uh, boys, boys, I don't care what you have to do.  Just set it up so the WAF is in the picture.  Right.  Somehow.  So don't set up like you normally sit every goddamn day you're here.  Right.  No, no.  Set it up all awkward.  Yeah.  I was just looking around the studio. 
[00:06:30]  I don't mean to barge it.  I'm looking for the Tiger Beat blonde.  Oh, wait.  Oh, there he is.  Dude, I'm going to start with that Iggy Pop stuff again real fast there.  I got my team beat at Tiger Beat.  Can you autograph it right here?  Just sign Opie underneath.  Right there.  Just sign it.  Now that's Hanson on the cover.  I don't know what's worse.  Anthony calling me the Tiger Beat blonde or you calling me Molly Ringwald.  Well, that was just that was a long time ago.  That's because you called me Iggy Pop.  Yeah.  Woo-hoo.  All right.  Let's get rocking here.  Me put water in pot.  Hook him up.  Onga, bonga, binga, bonga, bonga, binga, bonga. 
[00:07:00]  Phones ringing off the hook.  We'll go to them next.  4 in AF.  So what from Jane's Addiction?  It's Opie with my swarthy, wild-haired friend, Anthony.  Wow.  I can't believe all the facts is coming in with definitions.  If you don't know what's going on, we got an article in the Boston Globe today in the  back of the Sports Plus section.  And Anthony is described as the swarthy, wild-haired one.  And we're getting definitions all over the place coming in. 
[00:07:30]  And they all say, having a dark complexion or color, being of dark color, dark complected,  dark color, coloring.  My goodness.  Dark skin.  You know, if this was said about anyone of African descent, this would be like a racial  thing.  Of course.  And why would you have to bring up someone's skin color?  Of course.  Now, just because I am Sicilian, why would anyone dream of printing my skin tone in the 
[00:08:00]  newspaper?  And being the racist that I am, I can no longer work with you.  I refuse to work with Opie anymore.  I am going to rise up with my brothers and take you down.  We can no longer work together, obviously.  You, Opie, are a cracker-ass cracker, is what you are.  I'm a hunky.  I can say that because I'm swarthy. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, I...  And wild-haired.  I never realized this about your, uh...  One of you bangy tribesmen.  Yeah.  You're a butchman of the Kalahari.  I am Shaka Zulu.  I shall not be working with you anymore.  Of course not.  I cannot be seen with you anymore.  Really?  I had no idea this was what you were about.  You hid something from me when we met.  I did.  Obviously.  Obviously, if you read the Globe article, and you see that I am the swarthy, wild-haired  Anthony, and you look in the paper, swarthy says, be... 
[00:09:00]  Speaking of dark skin color.  Yeah, see, I thought you told me that, you know, it's because you were Sicilian, but  I don't think they describe Sicilians as swarthy.  No.  They describe guys that have bones through their nose as swarthy.  I guess I gotta get the bone through the nose, the big earlobes I gotta put so I can  get my arms through them.  I want the rings around my neck so I look like a giraffe, and a couple of plates in my  lips.  That's what I want.  And I want to do some of that stuff where you take the sharp stick of bamboo, and you 
[00:09:30]  raise up marks on your back in shapes of animals.  Where are you going for Christmas, Africa?  I am.  I am going back to Nigeria.  Dude, obviously, I can't work with you anymore.  You know, you've been reading the papers lately, and all the accusations about me.  I can't work with anyone that's swarthy.  I'm swarthy.  What can I say?  I can't believe it.  Well, it just goes to show you, you never know.  That's right.  My God.  I gotta get on the phone. 
[00:10:00]  Wait a minute.  Well, dude, I'm described as the tiger beat blonde, and you were the one that described  me that way to the lady.  Hold it.  I'm on the phone.  Wait a minute.  What?  Hello?  Yeah.  Jamming?  Yeah, I'd like to apply for a job.  Please?  No, I'm swarthy.  I swear.  It's in the paper.  Read it.  Come on.  Hello?  No, I think it'll work for you.  Why did you describe me as the tiger beat blonde?  I didn't.  It makes it sound like I say that about you all the time.  And this is my tiger beat blonde friend, Opie. 
[00:10:30]  Not only are you swarthy, you want to bend me over.  I'm homo.  What is that?  What happened to you?  I thought you were my partner of crimes.  Now I'm getting scared over here.  Yesterday, I was a white heterosexual.  Today, I'm a swarthy homo.  Well, I said to the woman that, you know, the girls like Opie.  They call up all the time, these young girls, and want to go out with Opie.  They're like 14 years old.  Yeah.  And I said he should be on the cover of Tiger Beat.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, I'm always calling Opie the blonde tiger beat blonde. 
[00:11:00]  The tiger beat blonde.  Tiger beat blonde.  What do I know?  I'm a swarthy, wild-haired Anthony.  My God.  Okay.  Power to the people.  I guess.  Wow.  Wow, what a turn of events this is.  Unbelievable.  107.3 WAF.  The only station that really rocks.
